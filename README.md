# Stock_sentiment_analysis
In this project, I built a stock market sentiment analysis pipeline using news headlines to predict market movements. 
I explored two main approaches: the first involved traditional Natural Language Processing, where I preprocessed news data using Bag-of-Words (with bigrams) and trained multiple machine learning models including Random Forest, Naive Bayes, SVM, and others to classify market direction. 
In the second approach, I extracted sentiment features using VADER and TextBlob, merged them with historical stock price data, and used Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) to predict stock market trends. This hybrid method achieved a high accuracy, highlighting the predictive power of combining sentiment signals with financial indicators.
